Exceptionally simplistic utility for the PlayStation2 that sequentially reads a disc's sectors and reports number of problems encountered.

== How to use with McFreeboot ==

# Compile and place discscan.elf on a USB drive
# Start uLaunch ELF
# Place the disc in the tray and close it.
# Navigate to discscan.elf and run it.
# Wait for it to run, with any luck it'll read the whole disc without issues.
